# Running optimization project using Arduinos, IMU sensors and Jupyter Notebook

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
1. Upload code from `running_track.ino` to the circuit
2. Capture data from the two running optimizer circuits (left and right)
3. Analyze the captured data from `Running_Analyzer.ipynb` jupyter notebook.

## Description

As a runner, I’ve experienced my fair share of injuries related to overuse and strain. When a specific muscle or connective tissue is strained, that part of the body won’t be able to produce the same amount of force (and movement is painful). As often the development of strain can be observed by an increasing amount of biomechanical asymmetries, I wanted to see if I could reflect that idea through the capturing of biomechanical data with motion sensors.
My goal is to create a combination of accelerometers and Arduinos to record acceleration over time and transform/translate the data for viewing. Once the data is compiled, I can analyze the data in order to see if the acceleration corresponds to patterns in my running gait and adjust accordingly if there are signs of weaknesses in my body or opportunities to improve my running gait, stride length, and other running technicalities.
